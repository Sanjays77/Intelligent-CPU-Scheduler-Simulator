# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduler-Simulator
CSE 316 project

The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a C++ based project designed to simulate and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority, and Round Robin. The project includes real-time Gantt chart visualization and performance metrics like average waiting time and turnaround time.

FEATURES :

Supports four key CPU scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF)

Priority Scheduling

Round Robin (RR)

CALCULATES:

Waiting Time (WT)

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Real-time ASCII Gantt Chart visualization

Modular and expandable C++ codebase

Version control and collaboration via GitHub

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL)

Tools:

GitHub for version control and collaboration

VS Code / Code::Blocks for development

ðŸ”§ How to Run

g++ simulator.cpp -o simulator
